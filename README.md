# Lionel Model Train Routing

For our Senior capstone project, we were asked to create a program that would allow users to control their Lionel model trains.  We created a Java program using JavaFX for the user interface to solve this problem.

## Track Layout

We needed to have a way for the user to input their track layout.  The solution that we came up with was a drag-and-drop solution where the user could select a track from the pane on the right-hand side of the screen, and then drag it over to the main canvas.  When two track pieces got close together, we would snap them together to signify that the program recognized that they were connected.

To the very far right of the screen, there are buttons that let the user remove the selected track, remove all tracks, and drag the mouse on the background to move around the canvas, respectively.
